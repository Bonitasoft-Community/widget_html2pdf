# widget_html2pdf

This widget allows to save your form/page in pdf.
You need to place the widget on every form/page and use it as a button that allows to download the pdf file.
There are two modes: entire page/form or only a specific div. Default mode is entire body. If you want to save a specific div (it could be a container or a widget), you should give it a specific (unique) class name of your choice, and use that class name as the property of the html2pdf widget.
